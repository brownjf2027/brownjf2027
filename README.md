- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jasen!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about web development with python code, flask, bootstrap, etc. I only code in my spare time, so I'm always learning.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, working with APIs, and whatever ever else catches my attention when I have time.
