- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jasen!
- Iâ€™m interested in learning more about web development with python code, flask, bootstrap, etc. I only code in my spare time, so I'm always learning.
- Iâ€™m currently learning python, working with APIs, and whatever ever else catches my attention when I have time. 

**Sleeper Fantasy Football Draft Tracker** 
- Repo: https://github.com/brownjf2027/SleeperTierSite
- Site is now live at: https://sleepertiers.com/

This was a fun project that replaces some APIs I was doing in Excel with VBA to make my fantasy drafts in Sleeper.com more efficient and easy. I always prefer using player tiers and keeping track of them throughout the draft as I make my decisions. Sleeper as a free API to use @ https://docs.sleeper.com 

You can see the API calls used for the site within the data.py file I've uploaded here as well. 

It was a way for me to practice the following:
- Flask for Web Development in Python along with HTML
- Boostrap and additional CSS for custom styling

# Updates for July 2024:
- Abiilty to find drafts by Sleeper username
- For live drafts on Sleeper projected points now matches scoring method of the draft (ppr, half-ppr, std, etc.)
- For live drafts on Sleeper, ADP is now included with color-coding based on when the player will likely fall: red for within next round, yellow for within 2 rounds.
- Manual draft tracker added.
- Some other CSS updates for display/readability.

## Behind-the-scenes:
- Admin login, which could be repurposed for user logins if people wanted to be able to save their own tier sheets to the site.
- Admin: feedback management and viewing within the site.
