- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jasen!
- Iâ€™m interested in learning more about web development with python code, flask, bootstrap, etc. I only code in my spare time, so I'm always learning.
- Iâ€™m currently learning python, working with APIs, and whatever ever else catches my attention when I have time. 

**Sleeper Fantasy Football Draft Tracker**
- Site is now live at: https://sleepertiers.com/

This was a fun project that replaces some APIs I was doing in Excel with VBA to make my fantasy drafts in Sleeper.com more efficient and easy. I always prefer using player tiers and keeping track of them throughout the draft as I make my decisions. Sleeper as a free API to use @ https://docs.sleeper.com 

It was a way for me to practice the following:
- Flask for Web Development in Python along with HTML
- Boostrap and additional CSS for custom styling
